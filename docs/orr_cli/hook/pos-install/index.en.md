# Guidelines for standardizing the names and areas of interest of institutions

## To ensure the standardization of information in the development of the DB, in relation to the institutions, confirmation of the following information was requested: ##

- Name of the institution;    
- Area of interest, such as a biome, river basin or state of the federation;    
- The acronym of the institution's name;    
- The website/portal link;    
- Any other information the institutions consider important.    

This procedure was carried out using a shared spreadsheet in order to facilitate the standardization of institutional information.
